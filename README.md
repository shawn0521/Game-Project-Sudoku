# Game-Project-Sudoku
This simple sudoku game uses for loops and clickable tiles as the main game. 
The actual puzzle is one that was auto generated and used the code itself does not generate random puzzles.
The grid itself was not made by me and is something that will change later on when I can make my own.
The puzzle is fairly simple using the default rule of being only 1-9 and with later updates will include more a wider range of numbers and a way to reset the puzzle.
