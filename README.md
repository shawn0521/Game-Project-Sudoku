# Game-Project-Sudoku

The sudoku game is made of three things
index.html
style.css
script.js

the objective of sudoku is to complete the puzzle by filling in the blank spaces with the numbers 1-9 without any duplicates in the row and column

the challenge of this project was using for loops to basically do the heavy lifting of the game as I still personally dont understand how forloops actually work.

There are some things that I want to add/change some of those things include:
-the overall layout and look of the game, the grid and design are not mine. I used something from open source code that I found and would like to change to something that I made.
-the ability to reset the board or lose. 
-a feature that can generate a random puzzle, the puzzle in the game is the only one and one that I put in there by hand.
